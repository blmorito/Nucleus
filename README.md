# Project Nucleus

This is an android project collaboration app that uses PHP and MySQL
for the backend components. This was made for our thesis.
This is my first ever mobile app so there might be bugs and glitches
or slow performance. And also really really bad practices and no good OOP approach.
Planning to refactor this project with what I learned so far in my internship and
programming books.

## Installation

1. Compile or build this project on Eclipse ADT
2. Change the ip address in the Globals singleton class to the ip address of the router or
  network you are using.
3. Import the database on MySQL and put the php files on the htdocs directory of xampp.
4. Test the app on a virtual device or an actual device to check if everything works.
5. If you have any questions regarding this request, feel free to comment on this repo
